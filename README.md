# grid_path_finder

This project simulates a vacuum cleaner navigating through a room represented as a 2D grid with obstacles. It calculates and prints the shortest path from the vacuum cleaner's starting position to a target position, avoiding obstacles and only turning at viable corners.

My program reads a 2D map of the room with obstacles.\n
It detects all valid "corner" positions that can be used to change direction.\n
It calculates the shortest viable path using a custom heuristic (A*-like approach).
Outputs the path as a series of directions:
L for Left
R for Right
U for Up
D for Down
Visualizes the final path in the grid.

The program expects input from stdin in the following format:

Edit
<dimension>
<start_x> <start_y>
<target_x> <target_y>
<grid> (row by row, top to bottom)
dimension: Integer for the size of the square grid (e.g., 10).
start_x, start_y: Starting position of the vacuum.
target_x, target_y: Target location to reach.
grid: A grid of 0s (empty space) and 1s (obstacles), read top to bottom and left to right.

Output
The path as a string of directions (e.g., RRRRDDDD).
The updated grid with the path marked:
2 for visited path
3 for start and target positions

How It Works
Corner Detection: Identifies all corner points in the map that the vacuum can use to change direction.

Pathfinding: Uses a simplified custom A* algorithm prioritizing shortest travel distance and fewer turns.

Traversal Logic: Moves in straight lines between valid corners or endpoints only when the path is clear.

Limitations
Supports only axis-aligned movement (no diagonal).
Assumes a square grid.
No real-time interactivity â€” input and output are done via terminal.
